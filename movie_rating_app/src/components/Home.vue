          It's been nearly two years since Superman's (Henry Cavill)
          colossal battle with Zod (Michael Shannon) devastated the city of
          Metropolis. The loss of life and collateral damage left many feeling angry
          and helpless, including crime-fighting billionaire Bruce Wayne (Ben
          Affleck). Convinced that Superman is now a threat to humanity, Batman
          embarks on a personal vendetta to end his reign on Earth, while the
          conniving Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) launches his own crusade against the
          Man of Steel.

          In May 1940, Germany advanced into France, trapping Allied troops on the 
          beaches of Dunkirk. Under air and ground cover from British and
          French forces, troops were slowly and methodically evacuated from the beach
          using every serviceable naval and civilian vessel that could be found. At
          the end of this heroic mission, 330,000 French, British, Belgian and Dutch
          soldiers were safely evacuated.
